CASPER Toolflow
=================

Welcome to the documentation for ``mlib_devel``, the CASPER Toolflow!

What is mlib_devel?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``mlib_devel`` repository contains a set of FPGA DSP libraries and programming tools developed and maintained by the  `Collaboration for Astronomical Signal Processing and Electronics Research (CASPER) <http://casper.berkeley.edu/>`__. Within the collaboration, this collection of software is affectionately referred to as *The Toolflow*.

The CASPER toolflow allows you to generate signal processing designs using MATLAB's graphical programming tool ``Simulink``. These designs can be turned into FPGA bitstreams and loaded onto a variety of supported hardware platforms to perform real-time digital signal processing systems. CASPER also provides a Python software library for interacting with running designs:  `casperfpga <https://github.com/casper-astro/casperfpga>`__.

Using mlib_devel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For more information about installing and using the CASPER Toolflow, see the project's `documentation <https://casper-toolflow.readthedocs.io>`__.

CASPER also maintain a set of `tutorials <https://casper-tutorials.readthedocs.io>`__, designed to introduce new users to the toolflow.

Updating an Existing Toolflow Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can always update your installation of `mlib_devel` by pulling updated code from this repository. If you do this,      chances are you'll need to update your Simulink models to match your new `mlib_devel` libraries. A script is provided to automate this process. With your model open and active, in your MATLAB prompt, run

.. code-block:: matlab

   update_casper_blocks(bdroot)

This script will resynchronize every CASPER block in your design with its latest library version. Depending on the size of your model, it may take many minutes to complete! As always, back up your designs before attempting such a major operation. And, if you experience problems, please raise Github issues!


`mlib_devel` directory structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`casper_library`
  Simulink DSP libraries
  
`xps_library`
  Simulink libraries for tool-flow supported modules (ADC interfaces, Ethernet cores, etc.)

    Python classes for each yellow block in the simulink `xps_library`.

Setup
------

The software stack you will require to use the toolflow will depend what hardware you are targeting. Older hardware (ROACH2 and earlier) use the older Xilinx software (ISE) which forces the use of different tools.

The current compatibility matrix is below:

(Note that official support for ROACH plaforms is no longer provided, however `this version <https://github.com/casper-astro/mlib_devel/tree/d77999047d2f0dc53e1c1e6e516e6ef3cdd45632/docs>`__ of `mlib_devel` contains all ROACH related documentation and ROACH tutorials can be found `here <https://casper-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/roach/tut_intro.html>`__)

A Note on Operating Systems
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The recommended OS is Ubuntu as this is what the majority of the collaboration are using. This makes it easier for us to support you. If you are so inclined, you could also use Red Hat, but we definitely do not support Windows. You are welcome to try but you will be on your own. You could always run Linux in a VM although this will increase your compile times. 

With the exception of ROACH1/2, all CASPER hardware mentioned above has been fully tested using an Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 LTS distribution. However, both operating systems require a few tweaks to work properly.

Ubuntu 18.04:

Some common issues encountered in running the tools on 18.04 include missing packages and incompatibilities between the libraries used to build older versions of MATLAB/Vivado and the libraries that come with Ubuntu 18.04. Some tips on fixing these issues:

- If you encounter System Generator socket timeout errors when trying to open a model in Simulink, or are faced with errors about GUI function call recursion when double-clicking Xilinx blocks, installing KDE (``sudo apt install kde-full``) may solve this.
- If you encounter an error along the lines of `"MATLABWindow application failed to launch. Unable to launch the MATLABWindow application"`, this is due to library incompatibilities between 18.04 and MATLAB R2018a and can be solved using `this workaround <https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/397138-why-do-i-get-a-matlabwindow-application-failed-to-launch-error-when-launching-live-editor-app-des>`__.
- For more detailed information on debugging library clashes/missing libraries, `this blog post <https://strath-sdr.github.io/tools/matlab/sysgen/vivado/linux/2021/01/28/sysgen-on-20-04.html>`__ by Craig Ramsay very kindly steps through the debugging process of getting System Generator working on Ubuntu 20.04 and contains information that is equally applicable to debugging on 18.04 (such as using the ``ldd`` command to find missing/incorrect library dependencies, and then installing/excluding the relevant libraries as needed). 
 
Ubuntu 20.04:

For Ubuntu 20.04, there are a few limitations:

- You must install gcc-6.x or alternatively create the links suggested in the installation documentation found `here <https://docs.xilinx.com/r/2021.2-English/ug1483-model-composer-sys-gen-user-guide/Supported-MATLAB-Versions-and-Operating-Systems>`__
- If you find the System Generator gets stuck during initialization or when compiling: There are some toolboxes that can cause this. We recommend only having the required toolboxes installed. See also `this thread <https://support.xilinx.com/s/question/0D52E00006vF6FOSA0/model-composer-v20212-matlab-r2021a-gets-stuck-at-initialization-stage-on-ubuntu-20041?language=en_US>`__, for more information.
- If you find that you cannot simulate without getting gcc errors, you may need to update the Xilinx version of `as` to run the operating system version. This can be done by changing the link at `/tools/Xilinx/Vivado/2021.1/tps/lnx64/binutils-2.26/bin/as` to point to `/usr/bin/as` instead.

Ubuntu 24.04:

Ubuntu 24.04 was released on April 25, 2024. It is not supported by Matlab R2022a, Vivado 2023.1, nor Model Composer 2023.1. However, with a little tweaking, you can run the tools. Please note, that you do this at your own risk. This has not been thoroughly tested, is not the official toolflow, and also uses software not supported by the tools so getting support will be difficult. This is simply meant to offer some possible suggestions for those wishing to run on the newest long-term support release of Ubuntu.

- Use the AMD Unified Installer instead of the Self Extracting Web Installer since the latter has a habit of hanging. By doing this, it greatly increases the amount of on-disk space required to ~300 GB (although a lot of it gets cleaned up). 
- Make sure to install *Engineering Sample Devices* when you are installing Vivado.
- You may need *libncurses5* and *libtinfo5*, which are packages no longer included in 24.04. You can install them by typing the following in the Terminal. Please note that, in general, installing out-of-date packages is a security risk.

  #. For *libtinfo5*: 

       .. code-block:: bash

            wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/n/ncurses/libtinfo5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i libtinfo5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb && rm -f  libtinfo5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb

  #. For *libncurses5*:

       .. code-block:: bash

            wget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/n/ncurses/libncurses5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i libncurses5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb && rm -f libncurses5_6.3-2ubuntu0.1_amd64.deb

- Move *\$MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnx64a/libfreetype.so\** to an exclude directory. Assuming that you have defined *\$MATLAB_PATH* (given in *startsg.local*):

     .. code-block:: bash

          mkdir $MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnx64a/exclude
          mv $MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnx64a/libfreetype.so* $MATLAB_PATH/bin/glnxa64a/exclude
  
- Upon start-up, you may get a *libcanberra* error. You can resolve this via the following:

     .. code-block:: bash

          sudo apt install libcanberra-gtk-module
          sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/modules/libcanberra-gtk-module.so /usr/lib/libcanberra-gtk-module.so

     Source: `Matlabcentral <MatCent_>`_


- Dealing with the *hogweed* error requires installation of qt4. Note that this is no longer included in Ubuntu 24.04, which includes qt6. Installing qt4 requires installation from a PPA. Two that seem to work are `rock-core <RockCore_>`_ and `ubuntuhandbook1 <UbuntuHandbook_>`_. Add the ppa repository using Ubuntu's Software and Update Center (outlined `here <UbuntuInfo_>`_). An example of entering this in the Terminal is given as:

     .. code-block:: bash

          sudo add-apt-repository -S 'deb https://ppa.launchpadcontent.net/rock-core/qt4/ubuntu/ focal main`


  After this, you can then install *libqt4core4* via :code:`sudo apt-get install libqtcore4`.


- As noted in the instructions for Ubuntu 20.04, Xilinx installs its own version of *binutils*, which is older than the one provided by Ubuntu. To fix this, you can symlink

     .. code-block:: bash

          mv $XILINX_PATH/tps/lnx64/binutils-2.37/bin/ld $XILINX_PATH/tps/lnx64/binutils-2.37/bin/ld.bak
          ln -s /usr/bin/ld $XILINX_PATH/tps/lnx64/binutils-2.37/bin/ld 

  Alternatively, you can perform only the first command and depend on */usr/bin/* being in your path.
